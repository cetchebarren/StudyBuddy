# Study your way
This tool was created at the request of law students who couldn't find a study tool that _quite_ fit their needs. But it was designed to be used by anyone!</span> 

Repetition is essential in retaining information, and for reciting that information when needed. StudyBuddy recognizes that. This tool allows users to customize their studying to fit _their_ needs, while also having the side benefit of working on their testing and typing speeds.

Users can take advantage of StudyBuddy's convenient features until all of their terms are completely solidified in their memory, and ready to be repeated on exam day! Good luck!

# Features

- **Custom Quizzes**: StudyBuddy allows users to create their own custom quizzes. A convenient user experience is critical. This is why when creating a quiz, users have the option to fill out their terms/definitions in the browser or to upload a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx file) to auto-fill the contents of their quiz. Users can search quizzes and sort/filter based on their needs. Quizzes can be liked for easy navigation! This way, classmates can set up quizzes and share with each other so that everyone can do well!

- **Quiz Options**: Users can choose if they want to test in written or multiple choice format, the order of the questions (example: randomized), and even if they want the answer to be the term or the definition. This lets you study your own way and keep the quiz fresh. If you take advantage of these options, you won't be memorizing the quiz, but the contents!

- **Quiz Features**: Each quiz has a timer so that users know how long they take. After each answer, the correct answer is displayed against the user's answer and a score is given. In typed quizzes, this score is a percentage based on accuracy, and is only affected by the essential characters of the definition (example: punctuation mistakes are not important). During this time, the quiz timer is paused so that users can reflect on their mistakes without running up their overall time.

- **Leaderboards**: Not only does StudyBuddy have a Global Leaderboard that ranks users on their total time studying, but every individual quiz has its own leaderboards (for each combination of quiz options) so that users can challenge themselves (and their friends) for new high scores! This is a fun way to see your progress in action.
